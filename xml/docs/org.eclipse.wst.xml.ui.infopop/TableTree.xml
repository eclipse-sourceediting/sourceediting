		<description>The Design view of the XML editor represents your file simultaneously as a table and a tree, which helps make navigation and editing easier. Depending on the kind of file you are working with, content and attribute values can be edited directly in table cells, while pop-up menus on tree elements give alternatives that are valid for that location.</description>
