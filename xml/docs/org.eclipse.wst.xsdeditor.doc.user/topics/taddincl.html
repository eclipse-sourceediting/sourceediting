<h1 class="topictitle1">Adding include elements</h1>




<div><p>If your schemas are large, you might choose to divide their
content among several schema documents to make them easier to maintain,
reuse, and read.  You can use the <samp class="codeph">include</samp> element
to bring in definitions and declarations from the included schema
into the current schema. The included schema must be in the same target
namespace as the including schema. </p>

<div class="section"><p>The following instructions were written for the Resource
perspective, but they will also work in many other perspectives.</p>
<p>To
add an include element, complete the following steps:</p>
</div>

<ol>
<li><span>Open your XML schema in the XML schema editor.</span></li>

<li><span>In the Design view, right-click in the <strong>Directives</strong> section
and click <span class="uicontrol">Add Include</span>.</span></li>

<li><span>In the Select XML schema file wizard, you can include an
XML schema that is located in your workspace or you can include a
schema from an HTTP Web address. The XML schema file that you select
must have the same namespace as the current schema.</span>
<ul>
<li>If you want to include an XML schema located in your workspace:<ol type="a">
<li>Select <span class="uicontrol">Workbench projects</span> and click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>. </li>

<li>Select the schema that you want to import and click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</li>

</ol>
</li>

<li>If you want to include an XML schema located at an HTTP Web
address:<ol type="a">
<li>Select <span class="uicontrol">HTTP</span> and click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</li>

<li>Type the URL of the XML schema and click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> A
local copy of the schema is not stored in your workspace. If you validate
your schema, the schema's contents are checked from the URL that you
specify.</div>
</li>

</ol>
</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Optional: </strong><span>Use the Properties view to define
additional properties for your import element.</span>
<ol type="a">
<li class="substepexpand"><span>If you want to edit the location of the included XML
schema file, click the <span class="uicontrol">General</span> tab and type
the new location display in the <span class="uicontrol">Schema location</span> field.</span>
</li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Documentation</span> tab if
you want to provide any information about this include
element. </span> The <span class="uicontrol">Documentation</span> page
is used for human readable material, such as a description.
</li>

<li class="substepexpand"><span>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Extensions</span> tab if you
want to add application information elements to your annotations of
schema components. </span> The <span class="uicontrol">Extensions</span> page
allows you to specify the schema and add XML content to your annotations.
</li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

<div class="section"><p>Once you have added the include element to your XML schema,
when you define new elements, attributes, complex types, or simple
types where you can specify type information, any declarations from
the included schema will be available in the <span class="uicontrol">Type</span> list
for the element, attribute, complex or simple type.</p>
<p>For example,
if Address.xsd has the following content:</p>
<pre>&lt;complexType name="Address"&gt;
    &lt;sequence&gt;
        &lt;element name="name" type="string"&gt;
        &lt;element name="street" type="string"&gt;
    &lt;/sequence&gt;
&lt;/complexType&gt;
</pre>
and you have an XML schema called PurchaseOrder.xsd that
has added an include for Address.xsd, then when defining a new element
in  PurchaseOrder, you can select Address as its type.  </div>
