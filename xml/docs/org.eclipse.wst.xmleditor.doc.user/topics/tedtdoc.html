<h1 class="topictitle1">Editing DOCTYPE declarations</h1>




<div><p>The DOCTYPE declaration in an XML file is used at the beginning
of it to associate it with a DTD file. You can edit your DOCTYPE declaration
to change the DTD file your XML file is associated with.</p>

<div class="section"><p>The following instructions were written for the Resource perspective,
but they will also work in many other perspectives.</p>
<p>To edit your DOCTYPE
declaration, complete the following steps:</p>
</div>

<ol>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Design view of the XML editor, right-click <span class="uicontrol">DOCTYPE</span> and
click <span class="uicontrol">Edit DOCTYPE</span>.</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>The value in the <span class="uicontrol">Root element name</span> field
should match the root element of your XML file exactly.</span> You should
only edit the value in this field if your root element changes.</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>You can select a Public ID for any existing XML Catalog entries
by clicking <span class="uicontrol">Browse</span>. </span> The value in the <span class="uicontrol">Public
ID</span> field is the Public Identifier. It is used to associate the
XML file (using an XML Catalog entry) with a DTD file. For more information,
see <a href="txmlcat.html">Adding entries to the XML Catalog</a>.</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>The value in the <span class="uicontrol">System ID</span> field is the
DTD the XML file is associated with. Type the path of the DTD file (or browse
for it) you want the XML file associated with in this field. </span>  <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> When
the XML file is processed by the XML processor, it will first try to use the
Public ID to locate the DTD, and if this fails, it will use the System ID
to find it.</div>
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click  <span class="uicontrol">OK</span>.</span></li>

</ol>

<div class="section">If you do not have a DOCTYPE declaration in your XML file, you can
right-click in the Design view and click <span class="uicontrol">Add DTD Information</span> to
add one.</div>

<div><a href="../topics/txedtdes.html" title="The XML editor has a Design view, which represents the XML file simultaneously as a table with Node and Content columns and a tree. This helps make navigation and editing easier. Content and attribute values can be edited directly in the table cells, while pop-up menus on the tree elements give alternatives that are valid for that particular element.">Editing in the Design view</a></div>
