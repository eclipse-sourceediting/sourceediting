<h1 class="topictitle1">Editing in the Design view</h1>




<div><p>The XML editor has a Design view, which represents the
XML file simultaneously as a table with Node and Content columns and
a tree. This helps make navigation and editing easier. Content and
attribute values can be edited directly in the table cells, while
pop-up menus on the tree elements give alternatives that are valid
for that particular element.</p>

<div class="section"><p>For example, the <span class="uicontrol">Add child</span> menu
item will list only those elements from a DTD or XML schema which
would be valid children at that point.</p>
<p>When you have an XML
file associated with an XML schema or DTD file, certain tags and rules
for that file have already been established, which is why the Design
view can provide prompts (via a pop-up menu) for those tags. When
you create an XML file that is not associated with an XML schema or
DTD file, it has no tags or rules associated with it, so the Design
view cannot provide prompts for specific tags, but it can provide
prompts to create new elements and attributes.</p>
<p>For any XML file
associated with an XML schema or DTD file, you can use the Design
view to add any items defined in the XML schema or DTD (such as elements
and attributes) to the XML file. You can also use it to add processing
instructions and comments to all XML files.</p>
<p>To open and edit
a XML file in the XML editor, right-click the file in the Project
Explorer view and click <span class="uicontrol">Open With &gt; XML Editor</span>.
If necessary, click the <span class="uicontrol">Design</span> tab to open
the Design view.</p>
<p>To expand all the items in
your XML file, click the <span class="uicontrol">Expand All</span> button<img src="../images/expand_all.gif" alt="This graphic is the Expand All&#10;button" /> on the top right corner of the editor. To collapse
them, click the <span class="uicontrol">Collapse All</span> button<img src="../images/collapse_all.gif" alt="This graphic is the Collapse&#10;All button" /> on the top right corner of the editor.</p>
<p>If
you right-click the item that you want to work with, some or all of
the following options (as applicable) will be available from the pop-up
menu that appears:</p>
