<h1 class="topictitle1">Updating XML files with changes made to DTDs and schemas</h1>




<div><p>If you make changes to a DTD file or XML schema associated with
an XML file (that is currently open), click <span class="uicontrol">XML &gt; Reload Dependencies</span> to
update the XML file with these changes. The changes will be reflected in the
guided editing mechanisms available in the editor, such as content assist.</p>

<div class="section"><p>For example, you have a DTD file called "Contact.dtd" and an XML
file called "Contact.xml" associated with it. Contact.dtd contains a root
element called <kbd class="userinput">Contact</kbd> that can contain any of the
following children elements:  <kbd class="userinput">Name</kbd>, <kbd class="userinput">PostalAddress</kbd>, <kbd class="userinput">Email</kbd>.
If you remove the child element  <kbd class="userinput">Email</kbd> from the DTD,
you will no longer be able to add an  <kbd class="userinput">Email</kbd> child element
to your root element Contact in your Contact.xml file. This change, however,
will not come into effect until you save your changes in the DTD and click <span class="uicontrol">XML
&gt; Reload Dependencies</span> in the XML editor. Until you click it, you
will still be able to add <kbd class="userinput">Email</kbd> elements to Contact.xml.</p>
<p>This
feature is very handy when you are making updates to both DTDs and XML schemas
and XML files that are associated with DTDs and XML schemas.</p>
