<div><p>If you want to work with XML schema files that you created outside
of the product, you can import them into the workbench and open them in the
XML schema editor. The XML schema editor provides you with a structured view
of the XML schema.</p>

<div class="section"><p>The following instructions were written for the Resource perspective,
but they will also work in many other perspectives.</p>
<p>To import an XML
schema into the workbench, complete the following steps:</p>
</div>
